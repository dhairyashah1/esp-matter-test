project_name: rcp-uart-802154
label: Multiprotocol (OpenThread+Zigbee) - RCP (UART)
package: OpenThread
description: >
  This multiprotocol radio co-processor (RCP) application supports running
  OpenThread and Zigbee stacks simultaneously on a host processor.
  It uses concurrent multiprotocol (CMP) / multi-PAN functionality to run the
  802.15.4 networks simultaneously on the same channel.
  The host stacks and the RCP communicate using the
  Co-Processor Communication protocol (CPC), which acts as a protocol multiplexer
  and serial transport layer. The host applications connect to the CPC daemon,
  which in turn connects to the EFR via a UART link.
  Refer to *AN1333: Running Zigbee, OpenThread, and Bluetooth Concurrently on a
  Linux Host with a Multiprotocol Co-processor* for more information on running
  the multiprotocol RCP with different host applications.
