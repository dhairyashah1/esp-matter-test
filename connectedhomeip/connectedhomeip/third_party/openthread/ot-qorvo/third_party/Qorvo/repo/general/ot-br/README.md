## Introduction

This guide will describe the setup of an *OpenThread* Border Router (OT-BR).
The definition and use of a Border Router can be found here [OpenThread Border Router](https://openthread.io/guides/border-router).

We will setup an OT-BR using the QPG7015M as RCP.
See [QPG7015M](../../qpg7015m/doc/README.md) for the full detail on this platform.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware

The QPG7015M development kit contains a RPi, a QPG7015M module and an SD card with the necessary drivers.

### Software

The RCP binary for the QPG7105M is required. Specific build instructions will be added here.

## Setup steps

The generic flow is described on the [Openthread Build](https://openthread.io/guides/border-router/build) site.

*Futher specific items for a Qorvo based OT-BR will be added here.*

## Useage

Once the OT-BR is setup, a network can be formed and Thread devices can be connected.

We refer to [OpenThread Test connectivity](#https://openthread.io/guides/border-router/docker/test-connectivity) to check the setup.
