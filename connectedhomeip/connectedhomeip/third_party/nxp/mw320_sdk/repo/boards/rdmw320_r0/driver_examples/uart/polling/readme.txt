No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and Mini USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.
