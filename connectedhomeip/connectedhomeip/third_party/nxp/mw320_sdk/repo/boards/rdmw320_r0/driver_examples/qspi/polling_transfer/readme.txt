Overview
========
The qspi_polling example shows how to use qspi driver with polling:

In this example, qspi will send data and operate the external flash connected with QSPI. Some simple flash command will
be executed, such as Write Enable, Erase sector, Program page.
Example will first erase the sector and programe a page into the flash, at last check if the data in flash is correct.

Notice: While do program, it is not suggested to make the flash write frequency bigger than the core clock frequency.
In some tool chain's Debug version, this may cause core do not have enough speed to send data to flash.
The flash write frequency equals to QSPI working frequency plus data line number. For example, if QSPI working in 48MHz,
program command uses quad mode, the write frequency is 48MHz * 4 = 192MHz.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- RDMW320-R0 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
