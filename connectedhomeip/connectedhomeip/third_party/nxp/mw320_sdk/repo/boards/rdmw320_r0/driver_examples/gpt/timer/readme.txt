Overview
========
The GPT timer project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK GPT driver to use GPT as a timer.
It sets up the GPT hardware block to trigger an interrupt every 1 millisecond.
When the GPT interrupt is triggered a message a printed on the UART terminal.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- RDMW320-R0 board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and Mini USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
These instructions are displayed/shown on the terminal window:

You will see a "-" or "|" in terminal every 1 second:
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
